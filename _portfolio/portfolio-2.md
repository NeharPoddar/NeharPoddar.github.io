## 2. Medical Devices

### 2.1 Infusion Pump 
Delivers medications into a patient's body in a controlled manner.
- Engineered a comprehensive system employing vision detection algorithms, notably Hough transforms, analyzing RGB images captured by the pump's camera. This system accurately tracks drops and streams, precisely calculating the liquid flow rate.
- Implemented a versatile cost function for informed decision-making based on various detection outputs.
- Leveraged dynamic time warping (DTW) and Fourier transforms to synchronize flow estimation outputs with ground truth (scale data) accurately.

### 2.2 Insulin Pump
Provides precise insulin doses to manage blood glucose levels in individuals with diabetes.
- Designed a personalized differential equation model to compute basal and bolus insulin rates using continuous glucose monitor readings. This model considers meal times, types, age, and gender to offer tailored insulin dosage recommendations.
- Currently exploring Reinforcement Learning, Transformer, and GAN techniques on time series data to enhance insulin pump autonomy and reliability. The goal is to optimize insulin delivery without relying on user-input meal information.
- Additionally, developed a computer vision method to identify weld defects during device manufacturing. Employed various texture detection methods and Euclidean distance transform to assess weld thickness and identify defects.

### 2.3 Kidney Transportation Box
Developed a segmentation model to monitor changes in the size and color of kidneys, providing insights into kidney health for both pig and human kidneys. This model offers valuable information for doctors to better understand the kidney's condition.
