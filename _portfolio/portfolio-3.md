In this research, an automated methodology was devised, utilizing support vector machine (SVM) classification on whole-brain anatomical magnetic resonance imaging data. The primary objective was to discern between individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and healthy elderly subjects. Impressively, this approach achieved a mean correct classification rate of 83%, signifying its effectiveness in distinguishing between the two groups. Additionally, a segmentation model was engineered to autonomously partition 3D MR images into regions of interest (ROIs). This model successfully extracted significant gray matter characteristics, enhancing our understanding and analysis of the data. These developments mark significant strides in leveraging advanced technology to facilitate more accurate diagnoses and comprehensive insights into neurological conditions.
