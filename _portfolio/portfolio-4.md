During my internship, I was involved in formulating a revenue model that aimed to mitigate leakage by leveraging a combination of natural language processing techniques, the linear programming method, and SQL queries. The project involved utilizing Microsoft Power BI to analyze extensive data encompassing TRP (Television Rating Point) metrics across diverse shows, timeslots, and channels. This data served as the foundation for creating advertisement slot packages, ensuring consideration of ad pricing strategies and maintaining competitiveness while upholding commercial viability.
