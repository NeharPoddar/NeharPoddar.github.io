Throughout my internship, I engaged in a thorough analysis of the manufacturing process. This involved the creation of simulated machinery models to gauge and optimize productivity metrics. I applied regression analysis and CPM-PERT methodologies to identify pivotal process stages, aiming to streamline operations and reduce lead-time. Moreover, I performed mathematical computations to assess how expediting different activities affected both preceding and subsequent stages of the process, providing valuable insights into potential efficiency improvements.
