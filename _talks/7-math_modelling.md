title: "Modified SIR Modeling on the Spread of Ideas"
collection: talks
type: ""
permalink: /talks/mathmodeling
excerpt: " This project explores the dynamics of idea sharing by introducing a system of differential equations, incorporating SIR-like and population growth models to simulate the spread of shared ideas, analyzing factors such as user flow rates, identifying potential cyclical patterns, and incorporating a capacity limit to simulate a more realistic model within a community.
